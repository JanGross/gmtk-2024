Theme: Built To Scale

### Core Loop:
Player mines base resources
- Stone -> Mason -> Brick -> Storage
- Clay -> Furnace -> Rooftiles -> Storage
- Sand -> Furnace -> Glass -> Storage

Resources are being converted to products  
The final products are Bricks, Rooftiles, Glass

Final products can be used to build houses (new workers) or be contributed to the world map projects. 

Reaching material milestones unlocks monuments on the world map.

Monuments are predefined buildings with material requirements based on real world references.

E.g. Pyramid of Giza = 2.3m stones

### Mining:

Minig material is manual at first.  
Once a house has been built 3 workers join the workforce.  
Workers can be distributed among the base mining facilities to passively mine resources.  

### Production: 
Each production facility can accomodate workers.  
Additional workers increase output per workshift.

### World Map
The world map contains predefined monuments.  
Reaching enough materials (contributed) to complete a monument unlocks it on the world map.  
Unlocking all monuments completes the game.

### Optional
- Additional facility upgrades to decrease shift time
- Global World map
- Savegames
